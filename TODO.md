[Alina] use expert data to train a q-value estimator

[Alina] Use expert data to identify similar states

    - how are states/features represented
    - what is similarity metric

[Samarth] identify states with high variance actions

[Samarth] figure out which trajectories to prune

    - decide horizon to use in comparing indifference vs uncertainty

[] Use pruned expert data to get performance from new dataset

[] plot to show performance on raw data vs pruned data
